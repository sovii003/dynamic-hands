This Colab notebook is used to train a Dynamic hand gesture recognition model
Dynamic hand gesture recognition with the use of rgb images is a topic of much ongoing research.
Currently, we are attempting several methods such as transfer learning and other fine tuning methods to increase the accuracy of the model.
This is the preliminary model that me and my teammate Sivasis Tripathy have built together.
Feel free to suggest any possible tools and techniques that may help us improve the model.
